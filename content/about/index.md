Hello. I am Dong Hyun Kim, a postdoctoral researcher at [(ETH Zurich)]([https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lipid/](https://systems.arch.ethz.ch/dong-hyun-kim)). My work centers on building science and human comfort, with a focus on creating sustainable, climate-responsive designs and innovative daylighting strategies. At ETH Zurich, I explore how people interact with building facade systems, like adaptive solar facades (ASFs), to optimize thermal and visual comfort. My research aims to develop AI-driven control systems that learn from occupant behaviors to balance individual comfort needs with energy efficiency, enhancing the performance of buildings in real-world settings.

Before joining ETH Zurich, I held postdoctoral positions at [(EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lipid/) from 2021 to 2024 and at [(TU Delft)]([https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lipid/](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment) from 2018 to 2020. At EPFL, I investigated factors affecting visual comfort under both daylight and artificial lighting, helping refine predictive models for better building design. At TU Delft, I studied indoor air quality and its impact on occupant health in offices, as well as comfort challenges in schools and other educational spaces.

I hold a PhD in Built Environment (2018) from University College London [(UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/). My PhD [thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10042464/) explored the emotional effects of artificiall lighting in office environments under the supervision of Dr. [Kevin Mansfield](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KPMAN87) and Prof. [Peter Raynham](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=PJRAY38). This work laid the groundwork for my onging commitment to human-centered building design

My research interests span `visual and thermal comfort`, `indoor environment quality`, `integrated design` and `zero-energy buldings`. Through my work, I aim to bridge advanced technology and sustainable design to create healtier, more comfortable spaces for peple.
