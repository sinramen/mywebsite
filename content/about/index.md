Hello. I am a postdoc researcher at the Laboratory of Integrated Performance in Design [(LIPID)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lipid/) in the Swiss Federale Institute of Technology, Lausanne [(EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). Under the supervision of Dr. [Jan Wienold](https://people.epfl.ch/jan.wienold/?lang=en) and Prof. [Marilyne Andersen](https://people.epfl.ch/marilyne.andersen/?lang=en) I am investigating the impact of view quality and sunlight patterns on various huuman perceptual responses. Broadly speaking, my research interests include `visual comfort` (including glare and visual preferences in relation to the outside view), `thermal/acoustical comfort`, `integrated design` and `zero-energy buldings`. 

I hold a PhD in Built Environment (2018) from University College London [(UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/). My PhD [thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10042464/) investigated pychological effects of lighting in an office context under the supervision of Dr. [Kevin Mansfield](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KPMAN87) and Prof. [Peter Raynham](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=PJRAY38). Prior to joinging EPFL, I worked as a postdoc researcher at the Chair of Indoor Environment in [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/bk) from 2018 to 2020. 

Besides the above topics, I am also conducting/involved in projects regarding HDR-imaging technologies and the related applications for glare studies.
