### [Creatinng positive atmosphere and emotion in an office-like environment: A methodology for the lit environment](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10127368/1/KIM_MANSFIELD_2021.pdf)
* In this study, participant emotion states were investigated when experiencing fifteen different lighting schenarios (concept design were  provided by professional lighting designer). The results indicated that positive emotions of *liveliness* could be cued under two lighting settings and that of *relaxation* under three lighting settinngs (of varying colour temperatures and light distribution). This study used bivariate 2-d kernel density estimates to differentiate emotions between 15 different lighting conditions on an *unpleasantness-pleasantness* and *activation-sleepiness* grid.

### [Clustering of office workers from the OFFICAIR study in The Netherlands based on their self-reported health and comfort](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320302195)
* [OFFCIAR](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/265267/reporting) was a European collaborative project, with an intentiion of a better understanding of factors affecting the indoor environment in modern office buildings. This study analysed the data from the Netherlands. The results indicated that females workers and the workers in open-plan offices reported signficianly more symptoms and compaints. TwoStep cluster analysis revealed three different profiles of office occupants based on their health symptoms and IEQ-related needs. Detailed descriptions of these three profiles were provided in this paper. This paper suggests that there is a need of an integrated approach to provide customized solutions for the differennt office workers who differed in their health problems and IEQ needs.
